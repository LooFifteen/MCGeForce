# MCGeForce

Automatically record kills, deaths and wins using Nvidia Highlights. Want any features? Post an [issue](https://github.com/SLLCoding/MCGeForce/issues) with your idea.

## Setup Instructions
Download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/SLLCoding/MCGeForce/releases/latest) and put it in your mods folder. When you start your game Nvidia GeForce Experience should show a popup asking whether to give `Minecraft` permission to record highlights and take screenshots, once agreed to, the mod is loaded. This will only happen on first startup. Now you can join a world or a server and see the MCGeForce buttons appear in the pause menu. The `MCGeForce` button takes you to the config and the `Clips` button shows you your recorded clips.

## Warnings
* MCGeForce has only been tested on Forge `1.8.9` version `11.15.1.2318` and support for other versions is currently not planned.
* MCGeForce uses Essential, it will automatically be installed on game start if not already installed. By using MCGeForce you agree that Essential will be installed and that you will be able to see Essential cosmetics in-game.
